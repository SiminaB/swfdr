#' Calculate the science-wise FDR (swfdr)
#' 
#' @param pValues Numerical vector of p-values
#' @param truncated Vector of 0s and 1s with indices corresponding to those in pValues; 1 indicates that the p-values is truncated, 0 that it is not truncated
#' @param rounded Vector of 0s and 1s with indices corresponding to those in pValues; 1 indicates that the p-values is rounded, 0 that it is not rounded
#' @param pi0 Initial prior probability that a hypothesis is null (default is 0.5)
#' @param alpha Initial value of parameter alpha from Beta(alpha, beta) true positive distribution (default is 1)
#' @param beta Initial value of parameter beta from Beta(alpha, beta) true positive distribution (default is 50)
#' @param numEmIterations The number of EM iterations (default is 100)
#' 
#' @return pi0 Final value of prior probability - estimated from EM - that a hypothesis is null, i.e. estimated swfdr
#' @return alpha Final value of parameter alpha - estimated from EM - from Beta(alpha, beta) true positive distribution
#' @return beta Final value of parameter beta - estimated from EM - from Beta(alpha, beta) true positive distribution
#' @return z Indicator vector of 0s and 1s - estimated from EM - with 1s indicating p-values from the null distribution
#' @return n0 Expected number of null p-values - estimated from EM - between certain cutpoints (0.005, 0.015, 0.025, 0.035, 0.045, 0.051)
#' @return n Number of p-values between certain cutpoints (0.005, 0.015, 0.025, 0.035, 0.045, 0.051)
