Title: Science-wise false discovery rate estimation
Version: 0.99.2
Author: Jeffrey T. Leek, Simina M. Boca
Maintainer: Simina M. Boca <smb310@georgetown.edu>, Jeffrey T. Leek <jtleek@gmail.com>
Description: This package allows users to estimate the science-wise false discovery rate from Jager and Leek, 
    "Empirical estimates suggest most published medical research is true," 2013, Biostatistics, using an EM approach
    due to the presence of rounding and censoring. It also allows users to estimate the proportion of true null
    hypotheses in the presence of covariates, using a regression framework, as per Boca and Leek, "A regression
    framework for the proportion of true null hypotheses," 2015, bioRxiv preprint.
