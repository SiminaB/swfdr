\title{Calculate the science-wise FDR (swfdr)}
\usage{
calculateSwfdr(
  pValues,
  truncated,
  rounded,
  pi0 = 0.5,
  alpha = 1,
  beta = 50,
  numEmIterations = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pValues}{Numerical vector of p-values}

\item{truncated}{Vector of 0s and 1s with indices corresponding to those in pValues; 1 indicates that the p-values is truncated, 0 that it is not truncated}

\item{rounded}{Vector of 0s and 1s with indices corresponding to those in pValues; 1 indicates that the p-values is rounded, 0 that it is not rounded}

\item{pi0}{Initial prior probability that a hypothesis is null (default is 0.5)}

\item{alpha}{Initial value of parameter alpha from Beta(alpha, beta) true positive distribution (default is 1)}

\item{beta}{Initial value of parameter beta from Beta(alpha, beta) true positive distribution (default is 50)}

\item{numEmIterations}{The number of EM iterations (default is 100)}
}
\value{
pi0 Final value of prior probability - estimated from EM - that a hypothesis is null, i.e. estimated swfdr

alpha Final value of parameter alpha - estimated from EM - from Beta(alpha, beta) true positive distribution

beta Final value of parameter beta - estimated from EM - from Beta(alpha, beta) true positive distribution

z Vector of expected values of the indicator of whether the p-value is null or not - estimated from EM - for the non-rounded p-values (values of NA represent the rounded p-values)

n0 Expected number of rounded null p-values - estimated from EM - between certain cutpoints (0.005, 0.015, 0.025, 0.035, 0.045, 0.05)

n Number of rounded p-values between certain cutpoints (0.005, 0.015, 0.025, 0.035, 0.045, 0.05)
